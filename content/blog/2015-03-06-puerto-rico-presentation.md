# Why an international presentation?

## Facilitating stronger connections in international civic tech community

This presentation is an experiment in creating stronger connections in the civic tech movement. Every week in communities around the world, thousands of civic hackers, open data advocates, designers of citizen experience, and tech activists get together in small groups to work on projects that improve their communities. Some projects are really successful. But the groups are very separate and rarely talk to each other and share lessons. This presentation from Stephanie in Puerto Rico to the Code for Cologne group is an attempt to facilitate stronger ties between international civic tech groups.

# Like the idea? Want to do it too?

## You can do one too

Organizing a presentation only need two parts:

 * A Host: Can your group host a similar international presentation via google hangout?
 * A Presenter: For this, the best presentations are ones that lead to action. Do you have an app that could be redeployed elsewhere? Or a story about organizing an event that worked really well? Or a story about another kind of project that could help other "Code for" groups?

If there are groups that want to set up another one of these, get in touch and we can set up another live stream event.
