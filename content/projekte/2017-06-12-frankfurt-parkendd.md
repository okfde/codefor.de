Displaying parking lot information for Frankfurt in a 5 min interval.

The city of Frankfurt displays parking lot information on [its website](https://www.frankfurt.de/sixcms/detail.php?id=2803&_ffmpar%5B_id_inhalt%5D=7994110#24278[Karstadt])
But it's list form is hardly helpful, so we've put that data on a map for you.

Redeployment of the gorgeous parkendd.de (link below) where the data is visible and where you can download the app for one of the four platforms to use the data on the go. It even has a prediction / machine learning feature.
