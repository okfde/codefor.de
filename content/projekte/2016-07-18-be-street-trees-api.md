The street trees project aims at providing an API for street tree data. We build a RESTful API on top of geospatially referenced tree data.

The API acts as the foundation for various client applications. The server takes all the burden of heavy processing, filtering large amount of geospatial data. This makes it easier for clients to query data based on their individual requirements.

You are welcome to <b>join the project</b>:
<ul>
<li>when you want to work on the Django-API or</li>
<li>when you have ideas on how to visualize the tree data or build an app</li>
</ul>
so the average citizens can benefit from it.
